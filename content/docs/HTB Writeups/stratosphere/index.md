I made this video way back in 2018 for a company meeting. I tried to give even non-technical people
a sense of how an attack is carried out. I put it on the HackTheBox Forums a couple weeks ago and decided to get it on my website too.

<div style="width: 100%; height: 800px;">
    <video controls style="width: 100%;">
             <source src="https://share.mailbox.org/ajax/share/042ef24700fe286d41a89d70fe284cdd970213046321e1ab/1/8/NDA/NDAvMjMzOA" type="video/webm">
    </video>
</div>

Have fun watching it!
