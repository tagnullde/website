# Security Policy

## Services in Scope
This policy begins on 01.01.2019.

All services and subdomains under these domains are in scope:

* *.tagnull.de

## Unallowed procedures

Please do not attempt to carry out DoS attacks, leverage black hat SEO techniques, spam mails, or do other similarly questionable things. I also discourage the use of any vulnerability testing tools that automatically generate significant volumes of traffic or try to brute-force logins.

## Qualifying vulnerabilities

* Cross-site scripting
* Cross-site request forgery
* Mixed-content scripts
* Authentication or authorization flaws
* Information leaks like:
  - Passwords
  - Files that "look like they better shouldn't be public"
* Server-side code execution bugs

## Reporting

Please contact me via <a href="mailto:infosec@tagnullde" target="_blank">email</a> with a written report of your findings. Please include all the steps that led to the exploitation of the vulnerability and also your contact details in order to be rewarded.

## Rewards

As this is a privately hosted site - I won't be able to provide you with high value bug bounties. But we might work something out.
