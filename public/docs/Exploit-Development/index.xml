      <description>Topic # I took the OSCP exam in 2020.&#xA;I wrote this to document my progress and give back to the community. It also might encourage you to take the exam yourself.&#xA;In this first installment I would like to talk about &amp;ldquo;Stack based Buffer-Overflows&amp;rdquo;. What are they? How do they work? How can you exploit them?&#xA;I am not a developer by any means. I have exactly 0% knowledge in C or any other compiled language.</description>

      <description>Introduction # In the last couple of days, I had some time and wanted to get a better understanding and some experience in modern binary exploitation techniques. Part of this learning process is to explain what I&amp;rsquo;ve learned to others. If you find an error, please let me know.&#xA;Also: While preparing for the OSCP I already tried a couple of protection bypasses like NX/DEP (Data Execution Prevention) with the ROPEmporium challenges.</description>
